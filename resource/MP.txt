You are supposed to implement a memory hierarchy based on the given configuration parameters. The parameters will be given in a mem.conf file. 
You need to read the file and initialize your memory hierarchy accordingly. You can assume that the main memory has infinite size and contains
every byte. You will also be given an access.in file which will contain a sequence
of ld and st operations. Your program will read the operations from access.in file and execute them in the memory hierarchy. At the end, it will output
the following information:
Level:L1
Access:xxx
Hit:yyy
Miss:zzz
(this pattern will repeat for the other cache levels)
TotalTime:zzz
