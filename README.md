# Architecture-project
This project is done as an assignment  for architecture machine problem. The code is written using jdk-1.8.0_144.

# Compatibility:
**I only used Linux system to run and test the code. Didnt test on windows pc. So for windows the following run command
may not work. To run in Windows you manually need to import the full project into your IDE and then have to run the
Run.java file.** 

# Compile:
Before running the project make sure the project directory contains the **bin** folder. Otherwise you have to make
it using: **mkdir bin** 

`**_Use the following command to Compile:_**`

1) make clean
2) make

# Run:
Use the run script to run the project: **`./run.sh`**

# Test:
All the test input file contains in the **`resource directory`**. To Run a specific test file just put
the ` mem.conf and access.in` files into to **`src directory`** and compile and run.
